Stage 2 for COMP3100 by Michael Thygesen - `45207275`

See [DCS Report] for further documentation.

### Implemented Algorithims
- Simple First Fit
- Custom Algorithm

### Demo Instructions:

1. Download/Clone Git repo

3. Extract/unzip downloaded file if need be

4. Make sure files have permissions by running `sudo chmod u+rwx [filename]` for the following files:
    * `ds-server`
    * `test_results`
    * `Client.java`
    * Might need to for these too: 
        * `Server.java`
        * `Job.java`


   E.g. `sudo chmod u+rwx ds-server`, essentially this gives the file read, write, and run permissions...


        
5. Once files have appropriate permissions go to the src directory
    * `COMP3100Stage2/src/`
    
    a. run the command: `javac Client.java`
    b. might need to do the same for `Job.java` & `Server.java`
    
6. Now finally run this command:
    * `./test_results java Client" -o co -c configs/other/`
    
7. Hopefully that should be it
